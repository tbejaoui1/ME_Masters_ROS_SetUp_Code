# ME_Masters_ROS_SetUp_Code
Mechanical Engineering Master's Thesis ROS Set Up and Code

ROS1 (Melodic), Ubuntu 18.04, MATLAB 2021b, iMac -> OS, software and PC used for this portion of the thesis. 

Goal: Install ROS1, MATLAB 2021b to setup desktop prototyping connection between the ROS master and global MATLAB node.
